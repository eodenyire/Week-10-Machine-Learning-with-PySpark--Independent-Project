# Week 10 Machine Learning with PySpark

# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction using PySpark
# Project Brief
<p> The project aims to develop a machine learning model using PySpark to accurately predict customer churn in a telecom company. By leveraging PySpark's distributed computing capabilities, we can handle large volumes of data efficiently and build a model that achieves a minimum accuracy of 0.8. The successful prediction of customer churn will enable the telecom company to implement proactive measures to retain at-risk customers, reduce customer attrition, and improve overall business performance.</p> 

# Problem Statement
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. The goal of this project is to develop a PySpark-based machine learning model that accurately predicts customer churn. The model should meet the following requirements:
<p> i. Achieve a minimum accuracy of 0.8
<p> ii. Leverage relevant features such as customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, call details, customer complaints, and churn status
<p> iii. Implement appropriate data preprocessing techniques, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation methodologies
<p> iv. Provide clear documentation of the project, including dataset details, preprocessing steps, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation results

# Guidelines
<p> 1. Dataset: Obtain a telecom customer dataset that includes relevant features. The dataset should cover customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, call details, customer complaints, and churn status. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset and identify any data quality issues.

<p> 2. Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the dataset using PySpark's DataFrame API. Handle missing values, perform feature scaling if necessary, encode categorical variables, and split the data into training and testing sets.

<p> 3. Feature Engineering: Create new features from the existing dataset that could be helpful in predicting churn. For example, calculate metrics such as call duration, average monthly spend, customer tenure, or customer satisfaction scores. Consider feature selection techniques to identify the most informative features.

<p> 4. Model Selection and Training: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for churn prediction, considering the problem nature and dataset characteristics. PySpark provides various algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting, and support vector machines. Experiment with different models and hyperparameter configurations to achieve the desired accuracy of 0.8. Utilize PySpark's MLlib library for model training and evaluation.

<p> 5. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Perform cross-validation and fine-tuning of hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

<p> 6. Documentation and Reporting: Maintain clear documentation throughout the project. Include details about the dataset, preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, model selection process, and evaluation results. Summarize the project findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned in a final report.

# Conclusion
The successful completion of this project will provide the telecom company with an accurate machine learning model for predicting customer churn. By identifying customers at risk of churn, the company can implement targeted retention strategies and reduce customer attrition. The use of PySpark's distributed computing capabilities enables efficient handling of large volumes of data, making it an ideal choice for this project. The comprehensive documentation and reporting will ensure the project's reproducibility and facilitate knowledge sharing within the organization.
